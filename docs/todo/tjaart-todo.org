   CLOSED: [2014-04-24 Thu 16:36]

** TODO [#B] Tutorial features

** TODO [#B] Add the ability to choose Thesis and Independent Study courses 
(perhaps add them into the XML during initial parsing - that way Peter doesn't have
to redo his algorithm entirely?)

** TODO [#A] Hook up starting date to backend

** TODO Search bar for "tags" of courses
** TODO Add button in Selection to "Add Pre-Req" and treat it as a Pre-Req
** TODO Add "International student button" that forces 3 course minimum
** TODO Add "Restricted status" check box that allows users to select undergraduate courses.
Added undergraduate courses increases required credits to graduate
** TODO In the instance of having "too many" completed courses
we take the "most necessary" course first and add them to the "total credit hours completed." This way we avoid adding too many wasteful courses to the courses completed.
