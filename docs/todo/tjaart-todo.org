* Use cases
** New student, no credits, want to go 1-2 courses a semester but only twice a week, interested in graphics

** New student, credits for 4760, waiver on 4250, wants to go 2 courses a semester no specific interests
waiting for bugfix in backend

** DONE New international student, no credits, interested in java 5010 but would need to take 4010 possibly first
   CLOSED: [2014-05-02 Fri 11:20]

** New international student, restricted status need to take 3130 and 2750.
This requires a lot of exra functionality

** Current student, completed 4250, 4760, 5500, and 5010, 4010, 4410. Wants to go 2 courses a semester preferably twice a week only if possible.

** Current student, completed 4250, 5010. Wants to go 2 courses a semester preferably twice a week only if possible, interested in evolutionary computation

** Current student, took 4250,4760,4010, 4610, 5130, 5500, 5700, 5010, 5890. (tricky)

** As above but waived 5320
Cant be done. As I understand the system only core courses can be waived, and 5320 is not required.
If you want to waive it as a prereq for the 6000 level course, you simply don't need to add it.

* Backlog

** TODO [#A] Adding dynamic buttons to Schedule display (anchor, etc.)

** TODO Add "Restricted status" check box that allows users to select undergraduate courses.
Added undergraduate courses increases required credits to graduate
** TODO In the instance of having "too many" completed courses
we take the "most necessary" course first and add them to the "total credit hours completed." This way we avoid adding too many wasteful courses to the courses completed.
